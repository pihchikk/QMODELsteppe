Attempts at calibrating QMODEL (Bosatta E., Agren G. I., 1991). 
Barefellow.py is a simplifed aproximation of the Q-model version used in Menichetti et al., 2019
(Menichetti, Lorenzo, et al. "Generic parameters of first-order kinetics accurately describe soil organic matter decay in bare fallow soils over a wide edaphic and climatic range." Scientific reports 9.1 (2019): 1-12.)
